A fast command-line tool for PDF manipulation written in Rust.

**Compress and merge** PDF files naturally and easily with this ready-to-use command line tool.
**Convert images** of any format into ready-to-use pdfs.

**~7× faster** than ghostscript (median, per-document on a 100-PDF corpus) and **~2× faster than single-threaded** rayon. Benchmarked in [`benches/docker/RESULTS.md`](benches/docker/RESULTS.md) — the headline figure is a median; best case is much higher, mean is lower.

## Features

- **Image recompression** — re-encodes images at a target quality, skipping CMYK images
- **Engine optimizations** — rayon-parallel re-encoding, mimalloc allocator, zlib-rs deflate backend, memory-mapped reads, deduplicated identical image streams
- **Structural compression** — object stream packing, xref stream compression
- **Batch processing** — compress multiple files in one command via shell wildcards
- **Smart output paths** — sensible defaults, explicit naming, or output to a directory
- **PDF merging** — combine multiple documents into one, with optional compression
- **Image conversion** — transform any image (.png, .jpg) into a .pdf
- **Merge docs and images** in a single command, with smart format detection

## Benchmark

Measured over 100 public real-world PDFs (≈300 MB, 5,268 pages), comparing
`presse press --quality 50` against Ghostscript `/ebook`. Full methodology,
per-document data, and correctness gates in
[`benches/docker/RESULTS.md`](benches/docker/RESULTS.md).

| | presse (rayon) | presse (serial) | ghostscript `/ebook` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total wall time (100 PDFs) | **81 s** | 123 s | 319 s |
| Mean per document | **0.81 s** | 1.23 s | 3.22 s |
| Mean size reduction | 19.5 % | 19.5 % | 60.5 % |

- **Parallel vs single-threaded**: 2.2× mean, 1.5× median. Best case ~6× on
  an image-heavy PDF (24 images, 16 cores) — the headline speedup of the
  rayon pipeline.
- **Parallel vs ghostscript**: ~7× median per document, ~4× total wall time.
- **Size**: presse reduces output without touching image resolution;
  ghostscript's `/ebook` downsamples images, so it shrinks files more but
  changes their resolution. Both figures are means over the corpus.

A reproducible containerized benchmark harness lives in [`benches/docker/`](benches/docker/):

```bash
docker build -t presse-bench -f benches/docker/Dockerfile.bench .
docker run --rm presse-bench
```

The container builds with `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"` (AVX2/FMA auto-vectorization) and reports wall time, throughput, and peak RSS for a generated corpus (text-heavy, image-heavy, scanned), comparing the rayon pipeline against a `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1` baseline.

## Usage

### Compress — `presse press`

```bash
# Single file — outputs document_compressed.pdf alongside the original
presse press document.pdf

# Custom output name
presse press document.pdf -o small.pdf

# Output to a directory
presse press document.pdf -o compressed/

# Batch — multiple files into a directory
presse press *.pdf -o compressed/

# Set JPEG quality (0–100, default 80)
presse press document.pdf --quality 60

# Cap image resolution to 150 dpi (75 screen, 150 ebook, 300 printer, 600 prepress)
presse press document.pdf -d 150

# Show size comparison after each file
presse press document.pdf --verbose

# Combine everything in a merged.pdf
presse merge *.pdf

# Convert images into pdfs
presse convert img1.png img2.jpg img3.jpeg

# Convert all png images, compressed them and merged them into a single pdf 
presse convert *.png -m -q 50

# Merge image and pdf together into a single pdf
presse merge *.png *.pdf
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `-o, --output` | `<input>_compressed.pdf` | Output file or directory |
| `-q, --quality` | `80` | Image recompression quality (0–100) |
| `-d, --dpi` | source resolution | Cap placed image resolution to DPI pixels/inch (75 screen, 150 ebook, 300 printer, 600 prepress); omitted = keep source resolution |
| `-s, --ssim` | `1.0` | Target output fidelity as measured SSIM (calibrated on grainy scans — the worst case for JPEG — so smoother content exceeds the target); lower = smaller and faster. `1.0` = use `-q` as given |
| `--palette` | `false` | Also build an `/Indexed` palette candidate for eligible flat-color images (figures, charts, scans) and keep the smallest of original / JPEG / indexed; exact palettes are lossless, lossy ones are gated on 0.9999 native SSIM |
| `--jpeg-encoder` | `false` | Use the pure-Rust `jpeg-encoder` codec (YCbCr 4:2:0, box-averaged chroma — libjpeg's default model, which Ghostscript/qpdf use) instead of the `image` crate's 4:4:4 encoder; smaller RGB output at the same `-q`, faster, but opt-in because luminance-SSIM courts don't see chroma loss |
| `--raster-classify` | `false` | Run the raster classifier on every decoded image: bitonal text/rules stored as a photographic RGB raster are re-stored as a lossless 1-bit CCITT G4 `/ImageMask` stencil (an RGB page → a few KB of G4); flat-color figures get the `/Indexed` palette candidate; photos and mixed pages are never masked. The smallest of original / JPEG / indexed / mask wins per image |
| `--recompress-flate` | `false` | qpdf-style structural recompression: decode existing `/FlateDecode` streams and re-encode them at the writer's level 9, keeping each only when smaller. Lossless (no content-byte changes); recovers the compression-level gap form tools leave behind |
| `-a, --acceleration` | `cpu` | Image transcoding backend: `cpu`, `auto`, `cuda`, or `rocm` (GPU backends require a feature build — see [GPU acceleration](#gpu-acceleration-experimental)) |
| `-v, --verbose` | `false` | Print size comparison after each file |

### Resolution capping (`--dpi`)

`-d <dpi>` downsamples images to at most `w·dpi/72 × h·dpi/72` pixels,
where `w × h` is the image's placed size on the page in points — the same
placement-aware rule Ghostscript applies with `-dPDFSETTINGS`. The cap is
strict: it **never up-samples**, and images whose on-page placement cannot
be determined (or that are already below the cap) keep their source
resolution. Only `press` takes the flag today.

```bash
presse press big.pdf -o small.pdf -d 150   # ~ebook: 150 dpi cap
presse press scans.pdf -d 75               # ~screen: 75 dpi cap
presse press deck.pdf -s 0.86              # ~q9: fidelity-targeted, 60% smaller on photos
presse press figures.pdf --palette         # also try indexed-color palettes
presse press photos.pdf --jpeg-encoder     # libjpeg-style 4:2:0 chroma (smaller, faster)
presse press scans.pdf --raster-classify   # bitonal pages -> 1-bit CCITT G4 masks
presse press forms.pdf --recompress-flate  # re-encode existing Flate streams at level 9
```

### Chroma subsampling (`--jpeg-encoder`)

`--jpeg-encoder` swaps the CPU JPEG encoder from the `image` crate's
full-resolution chroma (effectively 4:4:4) to the pure-Rust `jpeg-encoder`
codec at **YCbCr 4:2:0 with box-averaged chroma downsampling** — exactly
libjpeg/libjpeg-turbo's default RGB pipeline (`jpeg_set_defaults` +
`h2v2_downsample`), which is the model Ghostscript and qpdf use. That is
half the DCT chroma blocks of 4:4:4, so RGB output at the same `-q` is
smaller (−8% on the photo corpus at q50) and the AVX2 `simd` path encodes
faster. Grayscale images stay single-component on both paths. The flag is
opt-in rather than the default because a luminance-SSIM quality court does
not see chroma loss — the benchmark's native-image witness reports
per-channel SSIM so 4:2:0 output is judged on what it actually changed.

Why not the default: chroma subsampling is a quality tradeoff (invisible on
most content, visible on sharp saturated edges), and the default output
stays byte-identical to the pre-flag behavior. Only `press` takes the flag
today.

### Duplicate-image collapsing and palette quantization

Two structural optimizations are always on:

- **Coalescing** — after re-encoding, image streams that are semantically
  identical (same dictionary and same payload) collapse onto one object,
  and every reference is rewritten to it. Documents that embed the same
  photo, logo, watermark or figure many times (60 photos that are really
  20 unique images × 3 copies) shrink to the unique content once — e.g.
  22.96 → 6.46 MB at `-q 30` on the photos60 corpus file, below MuPDF's
  dedup result, with identical rendering.
- **Flate-wrapped JPEG** — DCT streams are normally incompressible, but
  padded/progressive JPEGs occasionally shrink under zlib; the
  `[FlateDecode, DCTDecode]` chain is used only when the full flate result
  is smaller.

`--palette` (off by default) additionally tries an `/Indexed` color-space
candidate for eligible flat-color images: one index byte per pixel plus a
≤256-entry palette, Flate-compressed — the representation that beats JPEG
on figures, charts, diagrams and screenshots. Images with ≤256 unique
colors convert losslessly; larger rasters go through a deterministic
median-cut quantizer and are accepted only above a 0.9999 native-image SSIM
gate, so a lossy palette can never visibly degrade a figure. Photos
effectively never qualify. The smallest of original / JPEG / indexed wins
per image. Only `press` takes the flag today.

### Raster classification (`--raster-classify`)

A scanned page stored as one RGB raster is usually not a photograph — it
is text and rules on paper, and the JPEG representation pays photographic
cost for document content. `--raster-classify` (off by default) runs a
small classifier on every decoded image — an adaptive Otsu threshold,
4-connected-component density and color statistics, all on a bounded
sample window (≤1024 px on the long edge) so a 28 MB scan classifies in
one pass — and routes the content:

- **Bitonal text / rules** → a lossless 1-bit CCITT Group 4 `/ImageMask`
  stencil (painted in the current color): an RGB text page becomes a few
  KB of G4, decoded pixel-identically by every viewer.
- **Flat-color figures** → the `/Indexed` palette candidate.
- **Photos / mixed pages** → the JPEG path (the within-image split into
  mask + continuous-tone layers is future work).

The decision is deliberately conservative — an image is masked only when
it is *mostly* black-and-white with glyph-sized components — so photos and
colored figures are never masked. The mask drops color and anti-aliasing
(bitonal content is black-on-white by definition), which is why the flag
is opt-in rather than the default. The smallest of original / JPEG /
indexed / mask wins per image. Only `press` takes the flag today.

### Structural recompression (`--recompress-flate`)

Form tools and older writers store `/FlateDecode` streams at a lower
compression level than this writer uses, so decoding and re-encoding the
*same bytes* shrinks the file without touching a single content byte —
qpdf's `--recompress-flate` trick (on the irs_fw2 scan corpus: qpdf's
1.81 → 1.34 MB). Only pure-Flate streams with no `/DecodeParms` are
touched (DCT/LZW/multi-filter chains and anything that fails to
decompress are left alone), each re-encoded stream is kept only when
smaller, and the pass is lossless: pixels, text, metadata and fonts are
unchanged, only the compressed representation differs. Only `press` takes
the flag today.

### Merge — `presse merge`

```bash
# Merge two or more files — outputs merged.pdf in the current directory
presse merge a.pdf b.pdf c.pdf

# Custom output name
presse merge a.pdf b.pdf -o result.pdf

# Output to a directory
presse merge a.pdf b.pdf -o output/

# Also compress images while merging
presse merge a.pdf b.pdf --compress
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `-o, --output` | `merged.pdf` | Output file or directory |
| `-c, --compress` | `false` | Compress images in the merged document |

## GPU acceleration (experimental)

`presse press` can offload JPEG re-encoding to a GPU with
`--acceleration cuda` (NVIDIA nvJPEG) or `--acceleration rocm` (AMD
rocJPEG). This is experimental, opt-in work — neither backend is linked
into the release binaries, neither runs in CI, and the CPU backend is the
default and always available. On a default build, `--acceleration cuda`
or `rocm` fails with an explicit "requires a build with the … feature"
error; build with the feature enabled to use them:

```bash
# NVIDIA
cargo install presse --features cuda --locked

# AMD
cargo install presse --features rocm --locked
```

`--locked` matters: the `baracuda` requirement is a caret range over
pre-releases, so without it Cargo may resolve a version the code has not
been tested against.

Runtime needs:

- **cuda** — an NVIDIA driver and the `nvjpeg` shared library. No CUDA
  toolkit is needed to *build*: the vendor library is loaded at runtime.
  Baseline 4:2:0 JPEGs are additionally decoded on the NVDEC hardware
  engine through the Video Codec SDK (`libnvcuvid.so.1`, a driver
  component — no toolkit library involved); the NV12→planar conversion
  runs a tiny kernel that ships as embedded PTX, JIT-compiled by the
  driver. Progressive / 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 JPEGs keep the nvJPEG decode path.
  Validated on an RTX 4080 SUPER with CUDA 13.3 (verify with
  `cargo run --release --features cuda --example nvdec_verify`).
- **rocm** — compile-tested only; requires a ROCm installation with
  `rocjpeg` at runtime.

If the driver or library is missing at runtime, presse warns and falls
back to the CPU encoder per stream — a broken GPU can never drop or
corrupt a stream. The NVDEC stage is optional the same way: when
`libnvcuvid` or the PTX JIT is unavailable, decode stays on nvJPEG
(`PRESSE_NO_NVDEC=1` forces that path). Measured behavior (threshold
routing, speed vs size tradeoffs) is documented in
[`benches/docker/RESULTS.md`](benches/docker/RESULTS.md).
