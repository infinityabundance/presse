## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`--jpeg-encoder`** (`press --jpeg-encoder`, off by default) — swap the
  CPU JPEG encoder from the `image` crate's 4:4:4 to the pure-Rust
  `jpeg-encoder` codec at YCbCr 4:2:0 with box-averaged chroma
  (libjpeg's default model, AVX2 `simd`): smaller RGB output at the same
  `-q` (−8% on the photo corpus at q50) and faster encodes. Grayscale
  stays single-component. Chroma-aware per-channel SSIM added to the
  native-image benchmark witness so the tradeoff is measured.
- **Duplicate-image coalescing** — image streams that are semantically
  identical (same dictionary, same payload; `/Length` and the cosmetic
  `/Name` hint ignored, indirect `/ColorSpace`/`/SMask` references
  followed) collapse onto one canonical object with every reference
  rewritten. Documents embedding the same image many times shrink to the
  unique content once (photos60 q30: 22.96 → 6.46 MB, below MuPDF's dedup
  result, rendering unchanged).
- **`--palette`** (`press --palette`, off by default) — an `/Indexed`
  color-space candidate for eligible flat-color images (figures, charts,
  scans): exact palette when ≤256 unique colors (lossless), deterministic
  median-cut above that, accepted only above a 0.9999 native-image SSIM
  gate; the smallest of original / JPEG / indexed wins per image.
- **`--raster-classify`** (`press --raster-classify`, off by default) — a
  raster classifier (adaptive Otsu threshold, connected-component density,
  color statistics on a bounded ≤1024-px sample window) routes bitonal
  text/rules to a 1-bit CCITT Group 4 opaque `DeviceGray` image — not an
  `/ImageMask` stencil, whose transparent white and current-color ink
  would change rendering (an RGB text page → a few KB of G4). The G4
  encoding is lossless; the RGB→bitonal conversion itself is lossy, which
  is why only near-perfect black-and-white content is masked
  and flat-color figures to the `/Indexed` candidate; photos and mixed
  pages stay on the JPEG path. Conservative by design: only mostly
  black-and-white rasters with glyph-sized components are masked. The
  smallest of original / JPEG / indexed / mask wins per image.
- **`--recompress-flate`** (`press --recompress-flate`, off by default) —
  qpdf-style structural recompression: existing `/FlateDecode` streams are
  decoded and re-encoded at the writer's level 9, each kept only when
  smaller. Lossless (no content-byte changes); recovers the level-6-vs-9
  gap form tools leave behind (irs_fw2 corpus: 1.81 → 1.34 MB — the same
  reduction qpdf's `--recompress-flate` achieves; qpdf's default writer
  leaves already-Flate streams alone).
- **Flate-wrapped JPEG** — retained or re-encoded DCT streams that shrink
  under zlib are stored as `[FlateDecode, DCTDecode]` when the full flate
  result is smaller (OCRmyPDF-style trick).
- **NVDEC hardware decode stage** (`--acceleration cuda`) — baseline 4:2:0
  JPEGs decode on the NVDEC hardware engine through the Video Codec SDK
  (`libnvcuvid.so.1`, a driver component; parser-free decode mirroring
  ffmpeg's `nvdec_mjpeg.c`) instead of nvJPEG's entropy-decode kernels;
  the NV12 output is de-interleaved to planar YUV by a tiny embedded-PTX
  kernel the driver JIT-compiles. Progressive / 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 JPEGs keep
  the nvJPEG decode. Optional: any init failure degrades to nvJPEG, and
  `PRESSE_NO_NVDEC=1` forces that path. Verified pixel-equivalent vs
  nvJPEG (≤1 IDCT rounding delta on <0.01% of pixels) by
  `examples/nvdec_verify.rs`.
- **Linear-time object renumbering** — lopdf's O(n²) `renumber_objects`
  replaced with a hash-map pass (67k-object doc: 530 → 62 ms); bounded
  dedup-cache hash (length + first/last 4 KiB).
- **Parallel image re-encoding** — image streams are detached from the
  `Document`, re-encoded concurrently with rayon on owned buffers, and
  written back in a single serial pass (document-lock-free; only the dedup
  cache is shared).
- **`--dpi` resolution cap** (`press -d <dpi>`) — placement-aware image
  downsampling with Ghostscript-style presets (75 screen, 150 ebook,
  300 printer, 600 prepress). Strict cap: never up-samples; images whose
  placement cannot be determined keep source resolution.
- **`--ssim` fidelity target** (`press -s <target>`) — a quality knob
  calibrated to measured SSIM (native 512-px window, worst-case grainy
  scans) instead of an arbitrary quality number. `-s 0.86` ≈ q9 and
  `-s 0.72` ≈ q6 on the calibration content; smoother content always
  exceeds the target. Lower targets compress harder and encode faster
  (photos20: 11.0 → 4.4 MB at `-s 0.86`, same-or-faster wall time).
- **Pluggable GPU transcoders** — `--acceleration cuda|rocm` behind a
  unified `ImageTranscoder` trait with graceful per-stream CPU fallback
  (opt-in Cargo features; not linked into default builds).
- **Regression suite** — 21 tests covering structural integrity (qpdf /
  ghostscript / `/Length` gates), visual SSIM, dpi-capping invariants,
  cross-reference reachability, grayscale component preservation,
  serial/parallel determinism, gapped numbering, and GPU fallback.
- **Benchmark + quality harness** — containerized 100-PDF benchmark,
  quality-vs-speed analysis (including MuPDF and the non-compressing Rust
  tools), a dpi sweep, and a multi-tool Pareto-frontier harness.
- `mimalloc` on the musl release artifact; `zlib-rs` deflate backend;
  memory-mapped input reads; deduplicated image re-encodes.

### Fixed

- **Cross-reference correctness** — objects are renumbered before saving,
  closing lopdf's gapped-numbering xref truncation (blank pages on large
  real-world PDFs; upstream tracked at J-F-Liu/lopdf#558).
- **Grayscale JPEG corruption** — `/DeviceGray` streams keep a
  single-component JPEG instead of a 3-component one that rendered as
  washed-out garbage.
- **Transcode cache** — keyed by quality, input kind, dimensions, and
  exact pixel bytes (equality on bytes, never a hash alone); a per-entry
  `OnceLock` guarantees one encode per unique image even under contention.
