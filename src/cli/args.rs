and scans have little chromatic entropy, so one index byte per pixel plus
a <=256-entry table Flate-compresses far below a JPEG. Images with at
most 256 unique colors are converted losslessly; larger rasters are
median-cut and accepted only above a 0.9999 native-image SSIM gate, so a
lossy palette can never visibly degrade the figure. Photos effectively
never qualify and keep the JPEG path.

downsampling — exactly libjpeg/libjpeg-turbo's default RGB pipeline
(jpeg_set_defaults + h2v2_downsample), which is the model Ghostscript and
qpdf use. That is half the DCT chroma blocks of 4:4:4, so RGB output at
the same -q is materially smaller (on the irs_fw2 scan corpus: 2.00 ->
~1.5 MB at q30, matching qpdf). Chroma loss is invisible to a luminance
SSIM witness, so this is opt-in rather than the default; the benchmark's
native-image witness reports per-channel SSIM to keep it honest.

Grayscale images stay single-component on both paths. The flag applies to
the CPU path and to GPU fallback. Default (flag omitted): the `image`

document compressor should use for text, instead of paying photographic
cost for it. (Deliberately not an /ImageMask stencil: a stencil's white

not a substitute for an opaque raster.) Flat-color figures are routed to
the /Indexed palette candidate. Photos and mixed pages are never masked.

The G4 encoding of the 1-bit payload is lossless; the RGB-to-bitonal
conversion itself is lossy (bitonal content is black-on-white by
definition, so this is the point of the flag), which is why the flag is
opt-in rather than the default and only fires on near-perfect
black-and-white content; on real scans the size win is large (an RGB
page -> a few KB of G4). Only the smallest candidate (original / JPEG /
