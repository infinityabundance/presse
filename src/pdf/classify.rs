//! Raster classification for the `--raster-classify` path.
//!
//! **Design rationale.** A scanned page stored as one RGB raster is usually
//! not a photograph — it is text and rules on paper, and the JPEG/4:4:4
//! representation pays photographic cost for document content. The OCRmyPDF
//! comparison showed the value of *representation selection*: plots, charts
//! and scans want different codecs than photos. This module is the small
//! `RasterClassifier` from the design note — no OCR, no tesseract, just the
//! signal machinery the classifier needs:
//!
//! 1. **adaptive threshold** — global Otsu on the sampled luma separates
//!    ink from paper without a fixed cutoff;
//! 2. **connected-component density** — 4-connected labeling of the
//!    binarized sample; text pages are hundreds of small glyph components,
//!    photos are few large blobs;
//! 3. **color statistics** — sampled unique-color count and neutrality
//!    (max−min < ε), distinguishing flat-color figures from photos;
//! 4. **ink / paper coverage** — the fraction of dark and near-white pixels.
//!
//! The decision is deliberately conservative: an image is `BitonalText`
//! only when it is *mostly* black-and-white with glyph-sized components —
//! a photograph or a colored figure is never masked, because the mask
//! representation drops color and anti-aliasing. The heuristic rules are
//! backed by one *measured* gate: the bitonal reconstruction (each pixel
//! replaced by its class mean) must fit the source luma within a small
//! mean error, so the RGB→bitonal conversion is verified per image rather
//! than assumed safe (see [`reconstruction_error`]). The routing is:
//!
//! ```text
//! BitonalText   -> 1-bit CCITT G4 opaque DeviceGray image
//! FlatColor     -> /Indexed palette (reuses the --palette candidate)
//! Photo/Mixed   -> JPEG (current path; the within-image split of
//!                  MixedDocument into mask + continuous-tone layers is
//!                  future work, documented in QUALITY.md)
//! ```
//!
//! All statistics run on a bounded sample window (≤1024 px on the long
//! edge) so a 28 MB scan classifies in a single pass; the output mask, when
//! produced, is full-resolution.
