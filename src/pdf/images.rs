//! Image re-encoding pipeline.
//!
//! **Design rationale, in one place:**
//!
//! 1. **Three phases** — (1) detach every eligible image stream from the
//!    `Document` into owned buffers; (2) rayon re-encodes them in parallel;
//!    (3) results are written back in one serial pass. Workers never touch
//!    the `Document`, so nothing in it needs a lock; the only shared
//!    structure is the dedup cache, which synchronizes itself. Detaching
//!    first (instead of locking per stream) is what makes the parallel
//!    phase document-lock-free.
//! 2. **32 KiB chunk size** (`CHUNK_SIZE`) — the one explicit fixed-size
//!    loop is the RGBA→RGB normalization: 32 KiB keeps the working set
//!    inside L1/L2 and, being a multiple of 4 bytes, never lets a pixel
//!    straddle a chunk boundary.
//! 3. **Dedup cache** — keyed by the *encoder input* (quality, kind,
//!    dimensions, exact bytes) so identical images encode once; the map is
//!    a `Mutex` held only for the cheap find-or-insert, and each entry is a
//!    `OnceLock` so competing workers converge on one encode (`get_or_init`
//!    blocks the losers). A hash alone is never treated as equality — the
//!    key compares the actual bytes.
//! 4. **Coalescing** — after the apply pass, image streams that are
//!    byte-identical (same dictionary, same payload) are collapsed onto one
//!    object and every reference is rewritten to it. The dedup cache makes
//!    identical images *encode* once; coalescing makes them *stored* once.
//! 5. **`--palette`** — an opt-in `/Indexed` candidate for plain 8-bit
//!    `DeviceRGB` rasters (default off): flat figures, charts and scans have
//!    low chromatic entropy, so one index byte per pixel plus a ≤256-entry
//!    table Flate-compresses far below what JPEG can reach. Exact palettes
//!    (≤256 unique colors) are lossless; larger rasters go through a
//!    deterministic median-cut quantizer and are accepted only above the
//!    512-px native SSIM gate.
//! 6. **Flate-wrapped JPEG** — OCRmyPDF's cheap trick: DCT bytes usually
//!    don't deflate, but padded/progressive JPEGs occasionally do; the
//!    `[FlateDecode, DCTDecode]` chain is used only when the complete flate
//!    result is smaller.
//! 7. **`--raster-classify`** — opt-in representation selection (default
//!    off): the raster classifier (`pdf::classify`) decides what each
//!    decoded image actually *is* before the size gate runs. Bitonal
//!    text/rules get a 1-bit CCITT G4 opaque grayscale image (`pdf::fax`) —
//!    the representation a document compressor should use instead of
//!    paying photographic cost — flat-color figures get the `/Indexed`
//!    candidate, and photos / mixed pages stay on the JPEG path. The
//!    classifier's routing, not a free-for-all: the indexed candidate is
//!    offered only to `FlatColor` content under this flag, so it can never
//!    turn a photo into a palette. The smallest of original / JPEG /
//!    indexed / mask wins per image.
//! 8. **Runtime fidelity admission** (`--jpeg2000`) — every lossy candidate
//!    is decoded back and measured against the source pixels on the native
//!    512-px window (`CandidateEvidence`) *before* the size court may rank
//!    it. JPEG2000 is the first implementation: the 85% rate target is only
//!    a sizing hint; a candidate that fails to decode, is dimensionally
//!    unfaithful, or reconstructs below `J2K_SSIM_GATE` never enters the
//!    size competition. Palette has its own native-SSIM gate
//!    (`PALETTE_SSIM_GATE`); the bitonal candidates are gated by the
//!    classifier's measured reconstruction error. `CandidateEvidence` is
//!    the template every future lossy representation (Jpegli, MRC, …)
//!    fills.
