//! Image re-encoding pipeline.
//!
//! **Design rationale, in one place:**
//!
//! 1. **Three phases** — (1) detach every eligible image stream from the
//!    `Document` into owned buffers; (2) rayon re-encodes them in parallel;
//!    (3) results are written back in one serial pass. Workers never touch
//!    the `Document`, so nothing in it needs a lock; the only shared
//!    structure is the dedup cache, which synchronizes itself. Detaching
//!    first (instead of locking per stream) is what makes the parallel
//!    phase document-lock-free.
//! 2. **32 KiB chunk size** (`CHUNK_SIZE`) — the one explicit fixed-size
//!    loop is the RGBA→RGB normalization: 32 KiB keeps the working set
//!    inside L1/L2 and, being a multiple of 4 bytes, never lets a pixel
//!    straddle a chunk boundary.
//! 3. **Dedup cache** — keyed by the *encoder input* (quality, kind,
//!    dimensions, exact bytes) so identical images encode once; the map is
//!    a `Mutex` held only for the cheap find-or-insert, and each entry is a
//!    `OnceLock` so competing workers converge on one encode (`get_or_init`
//!    blocks the losers). A hash alone is never treated as equality — the
//!    key compares the actual bytes.
//! 4. **Coalescing** — after the apply pass, image streams that are
//!    byte-identical (same dictionary, same payload) are collapsed onto one
//!    object and every reference is rewritten to it. The dedup cache makes
//!    identical images *encode* once; coalescing makes them *stored* once.
//! 5. **`--palette`** — an opt-in `/Indexed` candidate for plain 8-bit
//!    `DeviceRGB` rasters (default off): flat figures, charts and scans have
//!    low chromatic entropy, so one index byte per pixel plus a ≤256-entry
//!    table Flate-compresses far below what JPEG can reach. Exact palettes
//!    (≤256 unique colors) are lossless; larger rasters go through a
//!    deterministic median-cut quantizer and are accepted only above the
//!    512-px native SSIM gate.
//! 6. **Flate-wrapped JPEG** — OCRmyPDF's cheap trick: DCT bytes usually
//!    don't deflate, but padded/progressive JPEGs occasionally do; the
//!    `[FlateDecode, DCTDecode]` chain is used only when the complete flate
//!    result is smaller.
